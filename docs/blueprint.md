- Font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif for a precise, contemporary feel, suitable for headlines and body text.
- Minimal monochrome social icons adapt to the selected theme, maintaining a premium and refined aesthetic.
- Hero section features a full-screen animated WebP background, overlayed with text on the left, and navigation on the right.
